We're a group of to-be engineers, but we produce sounds of change, character and substance. Our society is a clear, pure and unrestrained expression of numerous forms of music, be it Indian classical, western classical, rock, electronic, rap, instrumental and fusion music. Our ideas and motives are simple: we see a world, starting from our immediate vicinity, where music is allowed to flow without any restriction, with utmost sympathy and with a strong objective of change, be it in oneself or a cause they feel attached to. For that very purpose, Crescendo has been working for over half a decade now to establish itself in the renowned cultural circuits of Delhi, and subsequently, India. We have been an epicenter of this visceral art, adding to our group of talented and imaginative musicians every year. We see music as an art that never discriminates and always welcomes ingenuity.",
